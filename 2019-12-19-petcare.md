### Dinner info (6pm)

Ernie gets one scoop of dry food. His food bag is in the cabinet and the scoop is inside. Food goes in the white and purple bowl on the counter.

Prince gets one scoop of dry food from the urn in the cabinet. The scoop is in the urn. His food bowl is under the bench.

## Breakfast info (flexible)

Ernie gets a half can of wet food (open the can and split it in half with a knife). His automatic feeder is on the counter. You can put in the food, turn the dial to 0 so that it will close, then turn the dial to the number of hours you want it to wait before it goes out. I usually set it up at 10pm for 6 hours, which means he eats at 4am. Anything around there is fine. You can also wait and feed him in the morning. He just gets cranky and noisy early in the morning when he hasn't had food -- that's why we got the auto feeder.

Prince gets a scoop of dry food from his urn for breakfast. He's generally pretty flexible about it so you can give it to him whenever you wake up.

## Prince bathroom and walks

### Bathroom

Prince usually goes to the bathroom after his breakfast, around 1 or 2pm, after his dinner, and before bed (around 9 or 10pm).

You can just let him out in the backyard to do his potty. He should also have at least one walk a day. He will also let you know he wants to go out by pawing at the door, though sometimes he does that even when he doesn't need to go to the bathroom.

### Walks

Prince's harness, leash, and coat are in the hatbox. There is also musher's wax next to the hatbox. If there is salt and wet snow out he needs the wax so his feet don't hurt. You can take each paw and rub it on the wax to put it on. (If you forget and his feet start to hurt you'll see him limp -- you should just bring him home then, he'll recover very quickly.)

## Ernie bathroom

Ernie's box is in the basement. We just got him a new batch of litter so it should be fine until we get back.
