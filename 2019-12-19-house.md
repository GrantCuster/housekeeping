## Snow removal

We're in charge of shoveling for the apartment. Hopefully it doesn't snow while you're there but if it does there is salt and a snow shovel under the stoop stairs (behind the brown curtain). The salt usually does most of the work on it's own. You'll need to shovel a path through the sidewalk and we usually try and clear off the stairs as well.

## Backyard door freezing

The black backyard door has been freezing lately (so you can't turn the key). It comes unstuck if you use the hair dryer on it. If you feel comfortable I'd just leave it unlocked (but shut) and lock the inside door.

## TV

You can turn the TV on on the side (we lost the remote). You can then use the Roku to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime. To hear the audio the stereo needs to be on and set to "CD".
